## 📦 Install

This app is dockerized, so you will only need to have docker and docker-compose installed in your machine. To execute this app you'll need to get the backend where all the docker files are located. The backend [is in this repository](https://github.com/ferminmine/agile-currency-exchange-backend).

Once you cloned the backend project that shares the same parent folder than the backend, you can follow the simple and short instructions of the backend install to execute the docker services and start using this client to navigate the app. Have fun!

## 🚀 Usage

If you executed this app via docker simply navigate to `localhost:3001` and you can start using the app.

### Run The Tests
If you are a developer new to this project always run the tests before you start coding! You can do this and get a cool coverage report using these commands:
```
npm test
```
If you are going to check in some new code never forget to add tests along with the commit that test the functionality, otherwise it will be rejected.
